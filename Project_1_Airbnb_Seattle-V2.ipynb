I was asked to select a dataset from three available options, completd some analysis with it answering three questions. The questions I chose can be found below. I then was tasked with writing a blog post with my findings which can be found here - [link](https://medium.com/@susiecrone93/booking-the-best-holiday-in-seattle-211e9764da17)\n",

    "The 3 questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> **Question One** - Are prices of available properties lower during seasons with higher available listings in Seattle?\n",
    "<br> **Question Two** - How does the properties cancellation policy affect their reviews? Do properties with a stricter cancellation policy have better reviews?\n",
    "<br> **Question Three** - Out of the properties available in Autumn or Spring, which are the 5 top ranked properties based on reviews we would recommend?\n",
    "\n",
    "<br> **Answer One** - During Autumn and Spring, availability is higher and prices are lower. During summer you can see prices increasing drastically and availability dropping. In winter availability and prices are both much lower. This is the only time that the points both fall together. Could it suggest that in seattle some holiday let landlords close up for the winter?\n",
    "When could be a good time to holiday in Seattle? - During Autumn or Spring\n",
    "<br> **Answer Two** - The properties cancellation policy has very little effect on the review score. Properties with a more relaxed policy score slightly higher than those with stricter policies, but this is not enough to suggest a significance. I would advice that people booked based on the cancellation policy they are most confortable with.\n",
    "<br> **Answer Three** - Above are the top 5 properties I would recommend checking out in Seattle, available in autumn and spring, based on the most reviewed and the highest reviewed.\n",
