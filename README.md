**Installation**
There are no additional libraries needed to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.

**Project Motivation**
This work is for project 1 if my Udacity Data Science Nano Degree I am completing.

1. Are prices of available properties lower during seasons with higher available listings in Seattle?
2. How does the properties cancellation policy affect their reviews? Do properties with a stricter cancellation policy have better reviews?
3. Out of the properties available in Autumn or Spring, which are the 5 top ranked properties based on reviews we would recommend?

Using data from Air BnB, I explored what should be considered when booking a rental property in Seattle. This information was then used to write a blog post on Medium, titled How to book the best holiday in Seattle! Here - [link](https://medium.com/@susiecrone93/booking-the-best-holiday-in-seattle-211e9764da17)

**File Descriptions**
There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above. First any packages are installed. Then the data is loaded in to a dataframe. Following this each of the three questions above are addressed and summarised. Mark up cells and annotations are used throughout for ease of reading.

**Results**
The main findings of the code can be found at the top of the Jupyter notebook and also at the blog post linked above.
